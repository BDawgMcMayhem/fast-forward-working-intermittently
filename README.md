fast-forward-working-intermittently
===================================

I've been using the fast forward feature playing a pokemon rom for about a week now with no issues.  Today I was using it just fine and saved it and quit the program.  Turned it back on later and the fast forward seems to be going in and out, with the fast forward button fully pressed down, both keyboard and ps3 controller.  I tried restarting the program and it still is acting up.  I'm addicted to the fast forward feature so can someone please help me?
